# RL-Adventure
Reinforcement Learning Adventure

## Intro

In this little project, I aim at summarizing the Reinforcement Learning algorthm, step by step. The motivation is to organize what I have learned from Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree and goes beyond that. Here I will write blogs and experiment codes for important papers in this area, starting with the recommandation in the Nanodegree.

The main 'Adventure' play ground will be in OpenAI's gym environment.

## Refences
**Notice** that many of my codes will be referencing the Nanodegree contents and other excellent implementations on Github.

## Recent Progress (up to 2019-04-02)

- Blogs writing (5% completed)
- Classic DQN (workable codes implemented, blogs 0% completed)
- Double-DQN (workable codes implemented, blogs 0% completed)
- Prioritized Replay DDQN (codes implemented, waiting for testing, blogs 50% completed)
- Dueling-DQN (reading paper)
