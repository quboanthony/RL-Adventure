# RL-Adventure
Reinforcement Learning Adventure

## Intro

In this little project, I aim at summarizing the Reinforcement Learning knowledge, step by step. The motivation is to organize what I have learned from Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree and goes beyond. Here I will write blogs and codes for the basic knowledges and also for the important papers in this area, starting with the recommandation in the Nanodegree.

The main 'Adventure' play ground will be in OpenAI's gym environment.

## Refences
**Notice** that many of my codes will be referencing the Nanodegree contents and other excellent implementations on Github.
